# ASR_report
Our code for the course 'Automatic speech recognition'

To look at the results for the first research question, please obtain the 'Italian voice and speech' dataset from: https://huggingface.co/datasets/birgermoell/Italian_Parkinsons_Voice_and_Speech/tree/70d1714cf738b248d687b003551351cbe37e0298/italian_parkinson
which is required to be able to run the notebook.

For the results of the second notebook, the results are available in the pre-run notebooks that start with 'ASR'. To run them youself, please make use of the repositry from Toye and Kompalli (2021), which can be found here: https://github.com/aeesha-T/parkinsons_prediction_using_speech

Then add the notebooks in the 'Modelling' folder and run them.


@Enes ToDo
stuur je notebooks en laat weten hoe je ze kan runnen.
